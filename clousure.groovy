/*
  Closures
  A Groovy Closure is like a "code block" or a method pointer. It is a piece of
  code that is defined and then executed at a later point.

  More info at: http://www.groovy-lang.org/closures.html
*/
//Example:
def clos = { println "Hello World!" }

println "Executing the Closure:"
clos()

//Passing parameters to a closure
def sum = { a, b -> println a+b }
sum(2,4)

//Closures may refer to variables not listed in their parameter list.
def x = 5
def multiplyBy = { num -> num * x }
println multiplyBy(10)

// If you have a Closure that takes a single argument, you may omit the
// parameter definition of the Closure
def clos = { print it }
clos( "hi" )

/*
  Groovy can memoize closure results [1][2][3]
*/
def cl = {a, b ->
    sleep(3000) // simulate some time consuming processing
    a + b
}

mem = cl.memoize()

def callClosure(a, b) {
    def start = System.currentTimeMillis()
    mem(a, b)
    println "Inputs(a = $a, b = $b) - took ${System.currentTimeMillis() - start} msecs."
